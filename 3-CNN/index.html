- Any problem with a spatial (or sequential) structure

# The Convolution Operation

- In Deep Learning we usually talk about Convolution networks, layers, operations

- Instead, most Deep Learning frameworks implement in practice a related function: the cross-correlation

<img src="images/cross_correlation_animation_1.gif" style="width: 200;margin-top: 0%" />
]
.right-column50[
<img src="images/cross_correlation_animation_2.gif" style="width: 200;margin-top: 0%" />
]
---

# The Convolution Operation

- Discrete cross-correlation between two functions $f$ and $g$:
$$
(f \star g) (x) = \sum\_{b-a = x} f(a) . g(b) = \sum\_{a} f(a) . g(x + a)
$$

- 2D-convolutions (actually 2D cross-correlation):

$$
(f \star g) (x, y) = \sum_n \sum_m f(n, m) . g(x + n, y + m)
$$

$f$ is a convolution **kernel** or **filter** applied to the 2-d map
$g$ (our image)
---

# The Convolution Operation

- Here is the computer vision point of view of the convolution operation

$$
(k \star im) (x, y) = \sum\limits\_{n=0}^2 \sum\limits\_{m=0}^2 k(n, m) . im(x + n, y + m)
$$

- Kernel $k$ here is of shape $(3,3)$ and image $im$ of shape $(6,6)$</br>

---

# The Convolution Operation

A snapshot example of the operations performed

- Element of the output tensor is formed by applying the kernel to the corresponding region in the input tensor

- Output is the sum of the entrywise (Hadamart) product between kernel and region of the input

.center[<img src="images/red_kernel_feature_map_1.png" style="width: 470px;margin-top: 0%;margin-left: 8%" />]
---

# Convolution in images

- What we just saw is the convolution operations between a $2$d kernel and a $2$d image

- An image is broken into several $2$d descriptions: $1$ per color
  -  RGB image is a 3d tensor (3, H, W), meaning 3 color matrix $(H, W)$

- Example of $3$d convolution formula with $(4,4,3)$ kernel

$$
(k \star im) (x, y, z) = \sum\limits\_{n=0}^{4-1} \sum\limits\_{n=0}^{4-1} \sum\limits\_{c=0}^{3-1} k(n, m, c) . im(x + n, y + m, z + c)
$$
---

# Convolution in images

- Feature map elements formed by applying a $3$d kernel to $3$d input regions
- Convolution operations for all $(x, y)$ lead to a (H, W) matrix
- Final output is a $(K, H, W)$ $3$d tensor:
  - One (H, W) matrix per kernel for all $K$ kernels
  - Sets of convolution operations performed by different kernels lead
   to different characteristics being extracted from the image
- Some padding used, we will see about that later

# Motivations for CNNs

- Convolution leverages three important ideas
  - **Sparse interactions**, **Parameter sharing**, **Equivariant representations**

Sparse interactions (Local connectivity)
- An output neuron depends only on a few local input neurons
- This is accomplished by making the kernel smaller than the input
.left-column50[<img src="images/sparse_vs_full_connectivity.png" style="width: 280px;margin-top: 0%;margin-left: 3%" />]
<br><br>
.right-column50.small80[
- $(Top)$ When $s$ is formed by convolution with a kernel of width $3$, only three outputs are affected by $x_3$
- $(Bottom)$ When $s$ is formed by matrix multiplication, connectivity is no longer sparse, so all of the outputs are affected by $x_3$
]
---

# Motivations for CNNs
Parameter sharing
- The same parameter is used in more than one function in a model
- In a traditional neural net, each element of a weight matrix is used **exactly once**
- In a conv' net, each kernel parameter is used at every location of the image (except boundary pixels)
<br/>
.left-column40[<img src="images/parameter_sharing.png" style="width: 350px;margin-top: 4%;margin-left: -15%" />]
.right-column60.small70[
- Black arrows indicate uses a parameter in an output
- $(Top)$ The black arrows indicate uses of the **central element of a 3-element kernel** in a convolutional model
  - Parameter involved in **all output neurons $s_i$**
- $(Bottom)$ **Single** black arrow indicates **single** use of the central element of the weight matrix in a fully connected model
  - Model has no parameter sharing, parameter involved in **output neuron $s_3$** only
]
---

# Motivations for CNNs

Equivariance of convolution to translation
- To say a function is equivariant means that if the input changes, the output changes in the same way

- Specifically, a function $f$ is equivariant to a function $g$ if <br/>
  - $f(g(x)) = g(f (x))$<br/>
  - $ f \circ g (x) = g \circ f (x)$

- In our context, saying that convolution is equavariant to translation means that:

.center[
  $Translation \circ Convolution(image) = Convolution \circ Translation(image)$
]
---

# Motivations for CNNs

# Multiple convolutions

.center[
          <img src="images/multiple_convolution_1.png" style="width: 650px;margin-top: -5%" />
]
- Red feature map $=$ result of all convolution operations
- Output feature map represents red kernel trying to extract one type of characteristic from the image at all locations
- .firebrick[**1**] kernel, .firebrick[**1**] set of
convoltution operations, .firebrick[**1**] feature map, .firebrick[**1**]
type of characteristic extracted, thus feature map output of shape
 (24,24,.firebrick[**1**]) and kernel params tensor of
 shape (5,5,3,.firebrick[**1**])

- $4$ stands for $4$ different kernels for $4$ sets of convolution operations and $4$ feature maps outputted, $1$ per kernel

# MLP vs Convolutional Network codes
**Fully Connected Network: MLP (Keras functional API)**

```python
input_image = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
x = Flatten()(input_image)
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
mlp = Model(inputs=input_image, outputs=x)
```

**Convolutional Network (Keras functional API)**

```python
input_image = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))
*x = Conv2D(32, 5, activation='relu')(input_image)
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(x)
convnet = Model(inputs=input_image, outputs=x)
```

# Strides
.small80[
- Strides: increment step size for the convolution operator
  - For stride size $k$ kernel performs convolution operation, skips next $k-1$ pixels and performs another convolution operation and so on
  - There are $vertical$ and $horizontal$ stride sizes which may not be the same

- Strides reduce the size of the output map
  - Stride of shape $(2,2)$ ($2$ $vertical$ and $2$ $horizontal$) reduce number of numerical outputted quantities by roughly $2 \times 2$
]
.center[
          <img src="images/no_padding_strides.gif" style="width: 215px;" />
]
.center.small[
Example with kernel size $3 \times 3$ and a stride of $2$ (image in blue)
]
---

# Strides

- Essentially used to reduce the number of activations and parameters in the
network and reduce the output dimensionality

- Allows to reduce the network number of parameters without diminishing
the number of filters

- Used when one does not want too much overlap between convolution operations
---


# Padding
[//]: #  (Useful to keep output spatial dimension of feature maps constant across kernels of different shapes)
<br/>
- Padding: artificially fill borders of image

- Useful with strides and large kernels

- Because of strides kernel might end up virtually out of the image

- Usually: fill with 0s

- Useful to preserve the dimensions of the input to the output

.center[
          <img src="images/same_padding_no_strides.gif" style="width: 210px;" />
]

# Dealing with shapes

**Kernel** or **Filter** shape $(F, F, C^i, C^o)$

.left-column40.small80[
- $F \times F$ kernel size,
- $C^i$ input channels: e.g. of colors
- $C^o$ output channels: number of feature maps

Kernel number of parameters: $(F \times F \times C^i + 1) \times C^o$
  - $1$ stands for the bias, 1 per kernel of shape $(F, F, C^i)$
  - There is $1$ kernel per outputted feature map

**Activations** or **Feature maps** shape:
- Input $(W^i, H^i, C^i)$
- Output $(W^o, H^o, C^o)$
]

.right-column60[
.center[
          <img src="images/multiple_convolution_4.png" style="width: 475px;margin-left: 10%" />
]
]

.small70.center[
$W^o = \frac{(W^i +2P) - F}{S} + 1$

$(P)$ being the amount of zero padding around borders, $(S)$ stride applied
]
---

# Dealing with shapes
Reminders about padding
.left-column50[
- Convenient to pad around borders
- Size of padding is a hyperparameter
]
.left-column50[
- To control the output spatial size
- To preserve shape of the input
]
.center[<img src="images/dealing_with_shape.png" style="width: 600px;margin-top: 2%; margin-left: -10%;" />]

- In example: $1d$ kernel of size $F = 3$, $1d$ input of size $W = 5$, zero-padding around borders $P = 1$
- Left: stride of $S = 1$, giving output of size $\frac{(5 + 2 \times 1) - 3}{1} + 1 = 5$
- Middle: stride of $S = 2$, giving output of size $\frac{(5 + 2 \times 1) - 3}{2} + 1 = 3$
- Right: No padding, output size is $3$: it is the number of kernels that horizontally fit across the image

---

# Dealing with shapes

**Constraints on strides**

- This formula means that hyperparameters have mutual constraints
- In $1$d convolution with zero padding example stride S = 3 was impossible
  - $\frac{(5 + 2 \times 1) - 3}{3} = 1.333\cdots$ i.e. not an integer, indicating that the kernels donât "fit" neatly across the input

**Going back to shapes**

- $W^i +2P$ represents virtual width of image with padding
- $(W^i +2P) - F$ represents space left on image after placing kernel over it
- convolution operation followed by stride produces $1$ scalar on feature map
  - $(W^i +2P) - F$ must be a multiple of stride
- $W^o = $ number of scalars produced during horizontal striding
 across image <br>
  - $W^o = \frac{(W^i +2P) - F}{S} + 1$

---

# Pooling

- No parameters: typically **max** or **average** of $n \times n$ units

- Using pooling we assume that each pool unit should be invariant to small translations of the input

- Useful when the presence of a feature in the image matters and not where it is in the picture

.center[
          <img src="images/pooling.png" style="width: 560px;" />
]

---

# Hierarchical representation

.center[
          <img src="images/lecunconv.png" style="width: 760px;" />
]
---

# Pre-trained models

- Training a model can take days
 if it has to extract concepts for lots of different classes
 from millions of images

- Many models are trained on ImageNet, their weights are publicly available

  - Those architectures and weights have been trained on datasets
   and hardware not normally available to the general public
---

# Transfer learning

- Load a public model

- Use the pre-trained weights by removing the layers used to address the specific problem (fully connected layers)</br>
&rarr; Stop at the last layer that extracts concepts (conv/pool layers)

- Loaded network is used as a generic feature extractor

- Add your own set of fully connected layers that lead to the answer to your task using the high-level representation of the image

- Train the weights of the newly added layers on the new task
---

# Data augmentation
.left-column40[<img src="images/cat.jpeg" style="width: 150px;margin-top: 3%" />]
.-column60[<img src="images/data_aug_2.png" style="width: 300px;" />]

- Object translations make the object invariant but the noise (background) changes

  - The model focuses on the invariant part to provide the answer

- Distorsion and rotations of the object enrich the model learning with shapes that
might not be in the training set but likely belong to the true distribution $(X, Y)$
---

# Data augmentation

With Keras:

```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

image_gen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1. / 255,
    rotation_range=40,
    width_shift_range=0.2,
    height_shift_range=0.2,
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    channel_shift_range=9,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)

train_flow = image_gen.flow_from_directory(train_folder)
model.fit_generator(train_flow, train_flow.n)
```

]

- Since 2010 **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge**
 (**ILSVRC**) is the competition where research teams evaluate
 their algorithms on the âImageNetâ image database
  - Tasks involve classification, detection from images and video
- They compete to achieve higher accuracy on several visual recognition tasks
- In **2012** **AlexNet** improved previous best score by **36**%

# Architectures: AlexNet

.center[
<img src="images/alexnet.png" style="width: 750px;margin-top: 0%;margin-left: 0%" />
]

- Depth of the model was essential for its high performance<br/>
&rarr; Computationally expensive, made feasible due to GPUs
- **AlexNet** contained eight layers; the first **five** were **convolutional
layers**, and the last **three** were **fully connected** layers
- Marked start of an industry-wide artificial intelligence boom in
usage of **deep convolutional networks**

          <img src="images/vgg.png" style="width: 450px;margin-top: 0%;margin-left: 0%" />
]
<br/>
- VGG = Visual Geometry Group, an academic group at Oxford University
- VGG is also the CNN architecture that secured $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$ spots
 in the localisation and classification tasks in ImageNet 2014

# Architectures: VGG-16

.center[
          <img src="images/vgg.png" style="width: 450px;margin-top: 0%;margin-left: 0%" />
]
<br/>
- The main contribution of VGG is to show that classification/localisation
 can be improved by increasing the depth of CNN in spite
of using smaller kernels
- CNNs prior to VGG used kernels $7\times7$ and $11\times11$ against $3\times3$ in VGG
<br>$\rightarrow$ But they were not as deep as VGG
- There are few variants of VGG, the deepest one has $19$ weight layers

Two appoaches to ResNet
- When network without ResNet skip connections goes deeper and deeper, training may go wrong
<br>$\rightarrow$ no longer extracts anything more useful from current feature maps
<br>$\rightarrow$ Network can neither stabilize current
feature maps by learning **identity function** that is
difficult to learn, thus training becomes worse
- The vanishing gradient problem, the output of a shallow layer disappears
through too many layers ahead in the network

# Beyond Image Classification

### Object detection

- We don't know in advance the number of objects in the image

- Object detection relies on *object proposal* and *object classification*

**Object proposal:** find regions of interest (RoIs) in the image

**Object classification:** classify the object in these regions

<br/>

**Object Detection = Object proposal + Object classification**

$\rightarrow$ One example: **YOLO algorithm**

---

# Beyond Image Classification

### Segmentation

- Output a class map for each pixel (for example: cat vs background)

  - We predict a class for each pixel in image

  - Usually classes are: âpixel belongs to object of interestâ
  or âpixel does **NOT** belong to object of interestâ (background)

$\rightarrow$ One example: **Mask-RCNN**

# YOLO - You Only Look Once

]

For each cell of the $S \times S$, predict:
- $B$ **boxes** - $4$ values per box for the center ($x$ and $y$), width ($W$) and height ($H$)
  - $x$ and $y$ relative positions in the cell, H and W are normalized
- $B$ **confidence scores** C ($1$ per box)
- $k$ **probabilities**, $1$ proba per class. Each proba is the probability of this class being inside the cell conditioned on an object being in cell

# YOLO - You Only Look Once

.center[
<img src="images/yolo1.png" style="width: 450px;" />
]

For each cell of the $S \times S$:
- Confidence scores are {$C_1, ..., C_B$}, probabilities are {$p_1, ..., p_k$}
- There are $B \times k$ $(C_i, p_j)$ pairs for each gridcell

# YOLO - You Only Look Once
.center[
<img src="images/yolo1.png" style="width: 450px;" />
]

For each cell of the $S \times S$:
- Considering pairs $(C_i, p_j)$ we keep cases where probability to **have an object in cell** is high AND **probability of classified object** is high
- We define a thresold
- Final detection (localisation + classif): pair gridcell and class $j$ where  **$C_i \times p_j > thresold$**

# Mask-RCNN

- A Deep Neural Network architecture to address segmentation

- It separates objects in images or videos

- For a given image, it outputs bounding boxes, class and binary mask for each box

<img src="images/mask_rcnn_example.png" style="width: 450px;" />
]
---

# Mask-RCNN

- Stage 1: a CNN, refered to as the backbone network, extracts characteristics from the image.
It outputs the image feature map
  - It is usually a ResNet or VGG, on its own or part of a FPN network.

- Stage 2: the Region Proposal Network (RPN) takes in the feature map, predicts input
regions that should have an object in them

- Stage 3: RoI align algorithm selects a fixed size subpart of the feature map for each proposed
region
  - It is used to predict a newly refined bounding box, the class and a $28\times28$
mask that is next extended to fit the proposed region
